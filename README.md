# Abaumannii_AMR_analysis
Python scripts for comparative genomic analysis of Acinetobacter baumannii
Python scripts and data processing pipelines for comparative genomic analysis of Acinetobacter baumannii strains from China, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia. This repository includes:

Genome retrieval and annotation using BV-BRC and Prokka

Extraction and consolidation of gene lists

Identification of consensus and unique genes across regions

Mapping of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes from CARD

KEGG-based metabolic pathway analysis and functional annotation

Comparative analysis of AMR-associated pathways across geographic regions

All scripts are documented with usage instructions, allowing reproducible analyses for genomic and functional characterization of A. baumannii.
